**Synchronize Data Series with Trading Client Framework**

BlitzTrader streamlines the visualization of your strategy's real-time state for traders, enabling seamless synchronization of vital moving state data (DataSeries) from the server to the client for graphical representation in the Trading Dashboard user interface (UI).  
  
**Scenario:**Imagine a server-hosted strategy that continually tracks technical indicators, generating fresh values for indicators and occasional signals based on trading rules at every bar close. Traders can utilize Data Series to visually interpret these live indicators and signals graphically.  
  
BlitzTrader provides a mechanism for strategies to define Data Series objects. These series can hold various data types, including:  
Integer|  
Long  
Double  
BarData (OHLC - Open, High, Low, Close)

The strategy updates these series on the server-side, and Blitz automatically synchronizes them with the client for real-time display.

**Available Data Series Types:**  
BlitzDoubleDataSeries: Stores double-precision floating-point numbers.  
BlitzIntDataSeries: Stores integer values.  
BlitzLongDataSeries: Stores long integers.  
BlitzBarDataSeries: Stores OHLC BarData objects.

To register a Data Series, use an API function like **RegisterDoubleBlitzDataSeries** for a specific data type. This function requires a unique name identifier and returns a reference to the created Data Series object. Any subsequent data updates are automatically reflected on the client-side.

```
private BlitzDoubleDataSeries _mtmDataSeries = null;
protected override void OnInitialize()
{
    .......................................
    .......................................
    string errorString = string.Empty;
    if (!base.RegisterDoubleBlitzDataSeries("MTMSeries", out _mtmDataSeries, out errorString))
    {
        TraceLogWarning("BlitzDataSeries [MTMSeries] registration failed. : Reason" + errorString);
    }
}
....................
....................
double currentMTM = GetCurrentTransactionMTM();

// Add new add point to a series.
_mtmDataSeries.Add(currentMTM);
```

This framework ensures that any changes in the server-side state are promptly reflected on the client-side, providing traders with up-to-date graphical representations of critical strategy data.

**News Data event**

  
News events offer invaluable insights into individual securities and the broader economy, often originating from sources external to the financial markets. This information is typically presented in text, elementized, or machine-readable formats and is sourced from reputable providers such as Dow Jones and Thomson Reuters.

BlitzTrader offers a robust framework to parse, normalize, and disseminate news information to your trading strategy. Whether it's an anticipated event triggering market reactions or unexpected developments impacting trading opportunities, BlitzTrader equips strategy developers with the tools to seamlessly integrate news events into their strategies. By subscribing to news providers, you can receive real-time News Data events as callbacks, empowering you to make informed trading decisions based on the latest market insights.  
  
When a news event occurs, the OnNewsDataEvent method is triggered, providing access to crucial details such as the news ID, actual value and forecast value.

```
string errorString = string.Empty;
if (SubscribeNewsDataUpdate("DOWJONES", out errorString))
{
    // Subscription to DowJones news provider successful
}
// More code...
protected override void OnNewsDataEvent(NewsDataEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    if (eventArgs.IsMachineReadableNews)
    {
        string newsID = eventArgs.ID;
        double actualValue = eventArgs.ActualValue;
        double forecastValueValue = eventArgs.ForecastValue;
    }
}
```


By incorporating real-time news data into your BlitzTrader strategies, you can gain a valuable edge in the ever-evolving market environment.  
  
**Options Pricing Library**  
  
Options represent a highly liquid asset class traded across numerous exchanges globally. Strategies centered around options often demand precise insights into options Greeks for effective risk management and portfolio optimization. BlitzTrader offers a comprehensive Options Pricing Library tailored to enhance your options trading strategies.  
  
For instance, consider a strategy like Implied Volatility (IV) scalping, which allows you to manage directional risk within your portfolio through Delta Hedging. This approach leverages Delta to calculate the necessary hedge position for open option contracts. By adjusting your exposure to the underlying asset based on Delta, you can effectively neutralize the directional risk inherent in options positions.

The BlitzTrader API includes an implementation of the classic Black-Scholes option model, enabling the pricing of both Calls and Puts. Additionally, it provides calculations for IV (Implied Volatility) and essential Greeks such as delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho. This library plays a pivotal role in strategies like IV Scalping, facilitating the computation of delta positions necessary for hedging open options positions by trading underlying contracts.  
  
The BlackScholes and OptionsGreek classes provide API methods for evaluating options pricing and Greeks, empowering traders to make informed decisions based on accurate pricing models.

**Index Data**

In the realm of the stock market, indexes play a pivotal role as benchmarks for assessing overall market performance. Commonly known indexes include the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500, NASDAQ, CNX NIFTY, and more. Essentially, an index is a statistical measure that tracks the changes in a portfolio of stocks, representing a specific segment or the broader market.

Indexes serve as essential economic indicators, reflecting the collective value of the underlying portfolio of stocks. Although derivative contracts based on indexes are tradable, here we focus on the non-tradable index data, which is disseminated by exchanges at regular intervals.

BlitzTrader offers seamless access to index data through its API model, allowing traders to incorporate this valuable information into their trading strategies. Index data can be retrieved by its unique name, which is typically designated per exchange segment, providing traders with insights into market trends and sentiment.  
  
Understanding the index value is vital for determining the moneyness of options, including whether they are in-the-money (ITM), at-the-money (ATM), or out-of-the-money (OTM) relative to the strike price of the instrument it represents.

```
// Retrieve index data for CNX NIFTY from NSECM exchange segment
IndexData indexDataNifty50 = GetIndexData(ExchangeSegment.NSECM, "NIFTY 50");

if (indexData != null)
{
    // Access index values
    double indexValue = indexDataNifty50.IndexValue;
    double lowIndexValue = indexDataNifty50.LowIndexValue;

    // Additional operations...
}
```
Following are some example of important indexes name as per their exchange segment:

| Index Name         | Exchange Segment |
|----------------|------------------|
| NIFTY 50       | NSECM            |
| NIFTY BANK     | NSECM            |
| INDIA VIX      | NSECM            |
| NIFTY MIDCAP 50| NSECM            |
| SENSEX         | BSECM            |
| BANKEX         | BSECM            |


By incorporating index data into your trading strategies, you can make informed decisions based on market direction and sentiment.  
  

  

**Market Data Event**  

BlitzTrader's API empowers your strategy by providing real-time market data, encompassing both Level-I and Level-II data. Level-I data includes best bid and offer quotes for tradable securities, offering a snapshot of current market prices. On the other hand, Level-II data delves deeper, revealing the highest bid prices, lowest ask prices, and corresponding sizes from various market participants for a specific security. This granular Level-II data is invaluable to traders as it sheds light on the buying and selling pressure behind individual securities.  
  
Before delving into the utilization of Blitz API for handling market data events and accessing price information, it's essential to grasp some fundamental market-related price terminologies.

**Market Depth**

Market depth, a component of Level-II data, offers insights into the supply and demand dynamics of a stock across different price levels. It serves as a crucial indicator of market sentiment, providing traders with a comprehensive view of the market's liquidity and potential price movements. Essentially, market depth displays the cumulative volume of orders at each price level, revealing the depth of the market's liquidity profile. This information is dynamic, continuously updating to reflect new orders entering the market and existing orders being executed or withdrawn. In essence, market depth provides traders with a comprehensive overview of current market activity, empowering them to make informed decisions based on the prevailing supply and demand dynamics.

  
Following is the snapshot of HINDZINC Securities up to 5 level depths. In market depth information, you can see a summary of all orders that are currently in the market. The information is continuously updated as new orders arrive and existing orders are filled or being pulled from the market.

![HINDZINC](https://github.com/pcnetworking/Markdown/blob/main/images/numbers.png?raw=true)


Let's illustrate the concept of 5-level market depth using an example of a fictional stock, XYZ Inc.

Suppose XYZ Inc. is currently trading at $100 per share. The 5-level market depth for XYZ Inc. would display the following information:

**Bid Prices (Buy Orders):**

Level 1 Bid Price: $99.95 (100 shares)  
Level 2 Bid Price: $99.90 (200 shares)|  
Level 3 Bid Price: $99.85 (150 shares)  
Level 4 Bid Price: $99.80 (300 shares)  
Level 5 Bid Price: $99.75 (100 shares)

**Ask Prices (Sell Orders):**

Level 1 Ask Price: $100.05 (50 shares)  
Level 2 Ask Price: $100.10 (100 shares)  
Level 3 Ask Price: $100.15 (150 shares)  
Level 4 Ask Price: $100.20 (200 shares)|  
Level 5 Ask Price: $100.25 (100 shares)

Here's what this information reveals:

**Bid Prices (Buy Orders**): These are the prices at which buyers are willing to purchase shares of XYZ Inc. stock. The bid prices are arranged from the highest bid price (Level 1) to the lowest bid price (Level 5). For example, at Level 1, buyers are willing to buy 100 shares of XYZ Inc. at $99.95 per share.

**Ask Prices (Sell Orders)**: These are the prices at which sellers are willing to sell shares of XYZ Inc. stock. The ask prices are arranged from the lowest ask price (Level 1) to the highest ask price (Level 5). For example, at Level 1, sellers are offering to sell 50 shares of XYZ Inc. at $100.05 per share.  
  
**Bid and Ask prices**

Bid and Ask prices play a fundamental role in the dynamics of the financial markets. The bid price represents the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a security at a given moment, while the ask price denotes the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell. Essentially, the bid reflects the demand side of the market, while the ask represents the supply side.

When referring to bids, it indicates the quantity of shares that buyers want to purchase at a specified maximum price. Conversely, asks signify the quantity of shares available for sale at a minimum price. The bid price is also known as the "buy" price, whereas the ask price is referred to as the "sell" or "offer" price.

Trades occur when the bid and ask prices converge, either by the bid price being raised to meet the ask price or vice versa. This convergence marks the point at which a transaction takes place between a buyer and a seller. Throughout regular market trading hours, bid prices typically remain lower than ask prices, resulting in what is known as a "**price spread**."

Understanding bid and ask prices is essential for traders as they navigate the markets, enabling them to assess the current supply and demand dynamics and make informed decisions regarding buying and selling securities.  
  
**Bid-Ask Spread**  
  
Spread, in the context of trading, refers to the variance between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price for a particular security. It essentially represents the gap between what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are asking for.

In highly liquid markets, where trading volumes are high, the bid-ask spread tends to be narrow. This indicates that there is a broad consensus among market participants regarding the fair value of the security. Conversely, in less liquid markets or during periods of low trading activity, the spread tends to widen. This widening occurs because there may be fewer buyers and sellers in the market, leading to discrepancies in pricing perceptions.

A narrow spread is advantageous for traders as it reduces transaction costs, allowing them to enter and exit positions more efficiently. On the other hand, a wide spread can erode potential profits, especially for short-term traders, as it implies a larger price differential between buying and selling.

Understanding and monitoring the bid-ask spread is crucial for traders as it provides valuable insights into market liquidity and pricing dynamics. By analyzing the spread, traders can gauge market sentiment, identify potential trading opportunities, and make informed decisions about when to execute trades.

![BID price](https://github.com/pcnetworking/Markdown/blob/main/images/BID%20Price.png?raw=true)


**TICK Size**  
  
Tick size refers to the minimum allowable price movement for a particular financial instrument in a trading market. It serves as the smallest increment by which the price of equity, future, or other exchange-traded asset can change. In essence, tick size dictates the granularity of price changes that are permitted during trading sessions.

For instance, let's consider the NSE Nifty, a prominent stock market index in India. The tick size for Nifty futures contracts is typically 0.05. This means that the price of the Nifty futures contract can only change in increments of 0.05 points. So, if the Nifty is trading at 11500, the next permissible price levels would be 11500.05, 11500.10, 11500.15, and so forth.  
  
If for any instrument the Tick Size is 00001. A price change, then, from 1.2345 to 1.2346 would represent one tick. Ticks do not have to be measured in factors of 10. For example, a market might measure price movements in minimum increments of 0.25. For that market, a price change from 450.00 to 451.00 is four ticks or one point.

Tick sizes are integral to maintaining order and consistency within financial markets. They are defined by regulatory bodies or exchange operators and are outlined in the contract specifications for each trading instrument. In futures markets, tick sizes are often fixed, whereas in stock markets, they may vary based on the price level of the asset.  

  
**Tick Value**

Tick Value refers to the monetary worth of a single tick, representing the smallest possible price movement allowed in a particular market. It is a crucial concept for traders as it quantifies the financial impact of price changes on their positions.

To illustrate, let's consider the E-Mini S&P 500 futures market, where the tick size is 0.25. This means that the price of the futures contract can move in increments of 0.25 points. Now, if the tick value is $12.50, it implies that for every 0.25-point movement in the price of the futures contract, the profit or loss for a trade would change by $12.50.

For instance, suppose a trader buys a single E-Mini S&P 500 futures contract at a price of 3000. If the price increases by one tick to 3000.25, the trader's profit would be $12.50 (assuming a long position). Conversely, if the price decreases by one tick to 2999.75, the trader's loss would also be $12.50.

Understanding the tick value is essential for traders to assess the potential risk and reward of their trades accurately. It allows them to calculate the profit or loss for each price movement and determine the appropriate position size based on their risk tolerance and trading strategy.  

Blitz Strategy API provides Event callback OnMarketDataEvent method in your strategy that developers need to override to get notification of change in market data information for subscribed instrument variable

  
This code snippet demonstrates how to handle various aspects of market data within the **OnMarketDataEvent** method, including retrieving bid/ask prices, checking for changes in the last trade, calculating VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), accessing the best quoted price, and retrieving instrument information.

**Persist Strategy Variable State**  
  
In certain scenarios, it becomes necessary for strategy developers to save the state of strategy variables, allowing for recovery across multiple runs of the strategy instance. While Blitz typically handles the storage of important strategy states, custom state-saving mechanisms may need to be implemented.

The Blitz API offers two methods for saving and retrieving variable states: **SaveStrategySetting** and **GetStrategySettings**.

```
private const string TotalTradeCounterKey = "TotalTradeCounterKey";
private int _totalTradeCounter = 0;

protected override void OnInitialize()
{
    object totalTradeCounterObject = base.GetStrategySettings(TotalTradeCounterKey);
    if (totalTradeCounterObject != null)
        _totalTradeCounter = (int)totalTradeCounterObject;
}

protected override void OnTrade(IVObject ivObject, TradeDataEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    _totalTradeCounter++;
    base.SaveStrategySettings(TotalTradeCounterKey, _totalTradeCounter);
}
```


In this example, TotalTradeCounterKey is a unique identifier name for storing and retrieving the state of the _totalTradeCounter variable. During initialization, the saved value of _totalTradeCounter is retrieved using **GetStrategySettings** and assigned to the variable. During trading events, such as OnTrade, the _totalTradeCounter is updated and then saved using **SaveStrategySettings** to persist its state for future runs.  
  
**Logging Mechanism in Strategy**  
  
The Strategy API's logging mechanism empowers your application to enable debugging information essential for diagnosing and troubleshooting issues effectively. Logging is a critical tool for debugging and diagnosing strategy-related issues, providing valuable insights into the application's behavior, current state, or important events.

BlitzTrader equips you with a robust logging API, enabling your strategies to record informative messages, warnings, and error messages.. These logs serve various purposes, from providing informative data about the strategy's current state to alerting traders about critical events or potential issues.  

BlitzTrader's logging API includes the following methods:

```TraceLogInfo(String infoText)```
```TraceLogWarning(String warningText)```
```TraceLogError(String errorText)```

Moreover, any text logged using the logging API will be displayed in the Trading Dashboard, offering real-time visibility into the strategy's activity. Additionally, the logged information is automatically stored in a Strategy file logger, ensuring comprehensive record-keeping and facilitating further analysis and review.

```
protected override void OnStopping()
{
    TraceLogInfo("Strategy Stopped.");
}
```


Developers can choose to enable conditional logging based on a pre-built input parameter called **ActiveProfiling**. This allows for strategic log placement, avoiding excessive logging that might impact performance. The value of **ActiveProfiling** can be set true or false from the Trading Dashboard Strategy Input parameter window.

```
 protected override void OnMarketDataEvent(StrategyMarketDataEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    if (base.ActivateProfiling)
    {
        base.TraceLogInfo(string.Format("New Market Data -> Instrument:{0}, BID:{1:0.00}, ASK:{2:0.00}, LTP:{3:0.00}, LTPTime:{4}",
                                                                    eventArgs.MarketDataContainerInfo.Instrument.DisplayName,
                                                                    eventArgs.TouchLineInfo.BestBidPrice,
                                                                    eventArgs.TouchLineInfo.BestBidPrice,
                                                                    eventArgs.TouchLineInfo.LastPrice,
                                                                    eventArgs.TouchLineInfo.LastTradedTimeDT.ToString("dd-MMM-yyyy hh:mm:ss")));
    }
}
